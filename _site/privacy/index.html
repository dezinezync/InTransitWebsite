    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information and your rights.</p>
<h2>End User License Agreement</h2>
<p>By using this application, you agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple Standard End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>.</p>
<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personal information on this website or within the application.</p>
<h2>Location &amp; Privacy</h2>
<p>InTransit requires &quot;Always On&quot; location permissions to process your location on-device to update for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing information</li>
<li>Next station information</li>
<li>Interchange information</li>
<li>Live Activities</li>
<li>Miscellaneous app uses</li>
</ul>
<p>Your live location is never transmitted by the app to InTransit, or any other third party. When fetching primary routing, your current location is only used to determine time to arrival at departure station. Coordinates transmitted in such manner are not tied to the individual user in any way.</p>
<p>No personally identifiable information is ever collected by the app. All data recorded is completely anonymous and does not include any identification markers. Any personally identifiable, willfully transmitted, information during support queries is entirely your choice.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
